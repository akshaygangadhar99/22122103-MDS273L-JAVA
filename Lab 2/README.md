## Important Points to note in the solution code:
1) do-while and switch case statements have been used to peform the major tasks
2) No in-built functions have been utilized
3) Self-written codes using functions such as charAt, string.length, etc have been used for minor conveniences
4) This is clearly evident in lines 21-31 and 53-65 where character-wise comparison is performed between 2 strings
