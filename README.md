## LAB 1
Write a Java Program that will collect your basic details that fall into different data types and displays them.
After the details have been displayed, with the help of conditional statements, check if the gender of the user is 'm' or 'f'. It should print "MALE" for 'm' and "FEMALE" for 'f'.
Assume that you can divide the states among India into four different regions (North, South, East, and West). If you are from the southern part of India; with the help of a switch statement, it should display The Student is from the southern states of India", along with the basic details.

## LAB 2
You are supposed to create a menu-driven program that has the following menu options:
1. Enter a name
2. Search for a name
3. Remove a name
4. Show all names

### Note:
The menu-driven program has to be made with the help of a do-while loop and switch-case statements.

### Constraints:
1. The names collected must be stored in an array with a max length of 1024.
2. The names in the array should be UNIQUE; no duplicate entries are expected!
3. Provide necessary validations that the user enters only valid names that are not going to be repeated.
4. Removing a name should not create empty space inside the array!

## Lab 3  
Create a java program that performs the following operation:  
The program should collect an integer array from the user.  

After the array is entered, you need to create a menu of items:
1) Find the Mean Value
2) Find the Median Value
3) Find the Mode Value
From the user-given array.  

### Note  
The program should have a minimum of 3 functions apart from the main function; each of the functions implements the Mean, Median, and Mode computation by accepting the array user has entered as a parameter and returning the value as a result. From the main method, you will display the result.  

## Lab 4  
### Write a JAVA Menu driven program that does the following:  

You can ONLY have the below variables as global variables:  
- Account Number  
- Account Holder Name  
- Account Balance  

You MUST have the below as functions:  
- To initialize the customer  
- To deposit money  
- To withdraw money  
- To print the transactions  
- To print account summary  

Your menu will have the following operations once the customer is created:  
- To deposit money  
- To withdraw money  
- To print the transactions  
- To print account summary  

## Lab 5  
Create a student class, that will store the details of the Student:  
- Reg. No.  
- Name  
- Email  
- Phone  
- Class  
- Department  

### Additional Constraints  
- The class will have a constructor to initialize the values of the Student and a method to print the Details of the Student.  
- In the main-method class, create an array of Student Class to hold maximum details of 100 Students.  

In the menu-driven program, the menu options will have:  
- Add a student  
- Adds the details of 1 student to the array of Student  
- Search for a student
    - Search for the details of a student from the array of Student  
    - (Optional) Searching can be done with Name & Register Number  
- Display all students  
    - Displays the details of all students 

### Extension (Optional):  
- Save the details of each student in a file, with his name with the help of a method in student class, when the student is getting created.

### Note: Make use of functions to implement the menu options  

## Lab 6  
Write a JAVA program that reads a file (text file) and finds the following details.  
    1. Vowels and their count. Eg: [a:100, e:45, I:55, ..]  
    2. Digits and their count. Eg: [0:1000, 1:10, 2:40, ...]  
    3. Top Five repeated words and their count.  
    4. Least Five repeated words and their count.  
    5. Top Five repeated characters and their count.  
    6. Least FIve repeated characters and their count.  
    
### Note:  
- Use the file attached.  
- Use functions to implement the six functions asked.  
- Pass the file content to the functions and return the values accordingly.  
- No Global variables are allowed to be used.  

### Additional Task [`htmlFile.txt`]:  
You have been given an HTML file; from the HTML File, identify the Top categories, display it to the user, and write the content to the file.  

## Lab 7  
Given the famous iris dataset, find the 5-point summary [Mean, Median, Mode, Min, Max] for the attributes: SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm.  

Once the overall summary statistics have been calculated, identify the summary statistics for each Species of iris flower [Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica].  

Present your results in the appropriate format and write the results in a file.
